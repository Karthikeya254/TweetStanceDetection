# Classification Techniques for Stance Detection
With the increase in awareness of social media platforms and the current scenario of exponentially increasing interactions between people in online forums like Twitter, it has become essential for organizations to understand what people think and identify the stance of their customers towards a target product or service of their own. Here, in this paper, we focus on the process of detecting the stance from tweets. It elaborates on the process of extracting features that contribute significantly to find the stance of the persons comments. Multiple techniques are explored and implemented to predict the user’s stance towards the target product in every tweet. Given a tweet and a corresponding target about which the tweet talks about, a stance detection system is built that determines whether the tweet is in favor or against or neither. Multiple stance detection models and techniques have been built and the model with the best accuracy for each of the given targets has been discussed and compared with other models.
